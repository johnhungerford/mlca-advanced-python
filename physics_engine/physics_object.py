    """
    This class should model a physical object in one dimensional space. Don't worry about dimensions or
    shape or anything. We'll treat it as a single point. It should have a pos_x, and a vel_x, and it
    should have a method that calculates its new position after a given change in time (delta_t). All
    these values should be `float`
