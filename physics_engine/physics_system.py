    """
    This class should model a system, or collection of physical objects. It should therefore consist primarily of
    a set of `PhysicsObject`s (see the other file in this directory). You should keep a careful eye on how `PhysicsObject`'s
    fields and methods are implemented. `PhysicsSystem` should include a method that updates the system after a
    change in time `delta_t`.
